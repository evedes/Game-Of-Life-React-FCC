Hi guys! I'm Eduardo Vedes (@evedes) and I've challenged myself in the first of January 2017 to reboot my career in 360 days. I've chosen to pursue a Full Stack Developer career. In order to achieve that I've started studying and practicing along in [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). I've already completed the Front End Certification and the Back End Certification and now I'm focused on the Data Viz Certification. I'm learning how to develop solutions with React Library and D3js.

This is my fourth REACT Project. I hope you like it!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### OBJECTIVE:

Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/reGdqx/.

Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### USER STORIES:

1. When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.

2. I can start and stop the board.

3. I can set up the board.

4. I can clear the board.

5. When I press start, the game will play out.

6. Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.
